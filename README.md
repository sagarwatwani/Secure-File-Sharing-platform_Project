Secure File Sharing Platform

Project Overview

The Secure File Sharing Platform is a web-based application designed to facilitate secure and efficient file sharing between users. The platform addresses key security challenges such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and interception during transmission by integrating robust security measures including end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.

Features

1. User Authentication

OAuth 2.0: Secure login via Google, Microsoft, or email-based authentication.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): OTP verification for enhanced security.

2. End-to-End Encryption

AES-256 Encryption: Ensures files at rest are protected.

TLS Protocol: Secures transmission of files between users.

3. Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Permissions for admins, uploaders, and viewers.

Time-limited access links for external users.

4. File Integrity and Anti-Tampering

Digital Signatures: Verify file authenticity and integrity.

Checksum Verification: Detects file corruption or tampering.

5. Activity Monitoring

Detailed Logs: Tracks upload, download, and access activities.

Alerts: Detects suspicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts.

6. Secure File Deletion

Secure wipe algorithms: Ensure permanent file deletion.

Security Measures

Authentication: OAuth 2.0 and MFA for strong verification, token-based session management.

Encryption: AES-256 for stored files, SSL/TLS for secure transmission, encrypted metadata.

Access Control: RBAC with custom policies, time-based access expiry.

Monitoring and Alerts: Real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and backup options.

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Angular)

Backend: Node.js or Django for handling APIs

Database: MySQL or MongoDB with encryption for stored data

Security Libraries: OpenSSL for encryption, JWT for authentication tokens

Expected Challenges

Balancing encryption security with file upload/download speed.

Securely managing key distribution and storage.

Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

Conclusion

The Secure File Sharing Platform provides a secure and efficient solution for sharing files while mitigating risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering. By leveraging strong encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, the platform ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of shared files.
